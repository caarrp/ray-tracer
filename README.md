# ray-tracer
A ray tracer in my interpretation:
    writing in C because I do not know C++
    starting with 3D vectors and their operations since that seems like an important basis.

407 project roll into the summer, personal tray tracer all the better to experiment with wave lengths, geometric projections, stereographic projections etc.
